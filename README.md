# Arch Install and Setip Documentation
## Step 1
The Arch Linux installation wiki ends without a GUI-based desktop environment (DE). You will choose and install a compatible DE. At very least, you should install LXQT, which is a very light-weight desktop that uses less hard drive space. BUT... this is not a requirement. Choose a DE that you like.

## Step 2
 Create a user account for yourself, justin, and codi with sudo permissions. The passwords for the instructor users shall be "GraceHopper1906" and be set to be changed after login.

## Step 3
  Install a different shell other than bash, such as zsh or fish.

## Step 4
  Install ssh.

## Step 5
  Add color coding to the terminal (like you see in the archiso during installation).

## Step 6
Set the system to boot into the GUI desktop environment.

## Step 7
 Add a few aliases to your shell configuration file (surch as .zshrc for zsh or .bashrc for bash). Need some ideas for good Linux aliases? Check here.
