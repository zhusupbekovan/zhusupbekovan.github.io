1) Add color coding to the terminal (like you see in the archiso during installation).

2) Set the system to boot into the GUI desktop environment.



Deliverable #2: Walkthrough Video
You will submit a walkthrough video showcasing your Arch Linux VM. Specifics / comments:

The video will be created / uploated to Panopto on Harvey.
The video will be bookmarked to allow easy navigation to different sections of the video.
There is no length minimum as long as it meets the below requirements. The average is around 5-9 minutes. However, the video should only be as long as necessary to complete the required tasks. I will not watch a video that is over 15 minutes.
The following tasks are required, in order, for your walkthrough video and each requirement shall be bookmarked in Panopto.

1: Installation Process Summary: Briefly introduce yourself and then briefly summarize the installation process you used for your Arch VM. It would be good to use the Installation Documentation you created during this part. You should not read each command you used aloud but instead briefly summarize the main steps in the process. This is not an install guide video - the VM should be completed before you start recording.

2: VM operation and configuration: Show the following in your video:

Log into the desktop environment (GUI)
Launch a shell and show the IP address of your VM
Show the user list
Show the sudoers
Demonstrate some of your aliases
Launch a browser (which means you need to install one) and navigate to your Github-Pages hosted installation documentation to show that you have Internet connectivity
Show any cool customizations (if any) you did
Pick some package to install from the Arch User Repository (AUR)
3: Problems: Provide a short list of any problems you encountered during the installation and how you overcame them. Again, this can be as simple as missing a step in the Arch install wiki or something else that required you to do some extra troubleshooting. If you missed a step in the install process, when did you figure it out and how did you get back on track?
