# Docker installationS

## Assignment Instructions
The assignment for this module is to set up an application using Docker and Docker Compose and document the process and any files used or created along the way (such as a docker-compose.yml or Dockerfile - if applicable). In other words, a fellow student of this course should be able to loosely follow your instructions to install the application themselves. After completing this assignment, post your documentation to you GitHub Pages website. Do not delete your Arch Assignment documentation. You may create an additional page or an index page to link to your projects if desired.

This assignment is not prescriptive in terms of which application is set up, although I encourage students to choose an application that is relevant to their interests is appropriate for their comfort level. Many open-source options exist on GitHub (and often include docker-compose.yml files).

If a student has an application they would like to Dockerize (like a web app from a personal project), then this could be used as an opportunity (or an excuse) to do so.

Below are a few ideas to look into, although students are not limited to this list:

- WordPress (very easy)
- PiHole
- Greenbone (formerly OpenVAS)
- This Example Voting App
- Gotify
- Uptime Kuma
- Bookstack
- Nextcloud
- Seafile
- Gitea
- GitLab
- SnipeIT

More inspiration can be gleaned from Awesome-FOSS/Awesome-Sysadmin and Awesome-Compose as well as many other online resources (link1), although be wary not to dive too deep for the sake of this assignment.



Note: do not run the result of this assignment in a production environment without properly securing your services (proper HTTPS, access control, etc.).
